/**
 * Controllers
 *
 * By default, Sails inspects your controllers, models, and configuration and binds
 * certain routes automatically. These dynamically generated routes are called blueprints.
 *
 * These settings are for the global configuration of controllers & blueprint routes.
 * You may also override these settings on a per-controller basis by defining a '_config'
 * key in any of your controller files, and assigning it an object, e.g.:
 * {
 *     // ...
 *     _config: { blueprints: { rest: false } }
 *     // ...
 * }
 *
 * For more information on configuring controllers and blueprints, check out:
 * http://sailsjs.org/#documentation
