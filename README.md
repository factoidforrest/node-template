### a Sails application


### Development setup steps

 install mongo and make sure it has no username or password on the database and trusts all localhost connections.  

npm installing everything.  just run npm install, everything is in the package.json so that should get your dependencies all set hopefully.

start the app with 'nodemon' when your terminal is in the root app directory with no arguments.  You might have to 'sudo npm install nodemon -g' before that will work..  To restart the server at any time, type rs into the terminal running nodemon and hit enter.  It will auto restart when any source code changes as well, which is the truly awesome part.
